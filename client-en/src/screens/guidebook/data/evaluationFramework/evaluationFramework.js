        introduction: <div>
            <p>
                Formative evaluation continuously evaluates the co-creation process to ensure that it is adding value to all the stakeholders and achieving what the process is supposed to achieve – that is, active and meaningful participation by all the relevant co-creators. For formative evaluation there are two interconnected aspects to consider. First there is the accessibility of the co-creation process—when setting up and planning the project: in other words getting appropriate citizens (e.g. older adults) to see themselves as relevant co-creators and participants in the project. Second, it involves ensuring that the co-creation process functions as an ongoing relevant and meaningful activity for all the stakeholders involved.
            </p>
            <p>Our research has shown that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Older adults often exclude themselves from the co-creation process, a priori. This might be for a number of reasons such as a lack the confidence to participate in the process, a lack of appropriate resources, and so forth. </li>
                <li>Older adults often have limited experience of being involved in creating services for themselves and therefore do not see or appreciate the relevance or potential of such approaches. </li>
                <li>The co-creation process can be time-consuming and make significant demands on older adults. They would tend to see this in terms of opportunity cost and opt to get involved in activities that are immediately relevant to them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Thus it is important to make sure that the co-creation project is relevant, meaningful and accessible to older adults (as, and while it is being planned). We suggest in this planning that a number of issues be considered, as outlined below. For formative evaluation of the co-creation process itself we recommend the following criteria (based on inclusive design) to be considered.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest that the formative evaluation is undertaken based on the reflective practice learning cycle, which leads to the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan</strong> the co-creation activities (as outlined in the co-creation streams in this guide). For this we provide a <a className="more-contrast" href="guidebook/materials?downloadName=Co-creation Intervention Planning Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a> to help prompt you on what to think about in this planning process. If this is not the first activity, look at lessons learnt from previous intervention activities to make sure that the planning reflects the lessons learnt. This planning is best co-created with the stakeholders (but minimally within the team).</li>
                <li>You then <strong>do</strong> the co-creation activity. It is important that somebody is designated to take on the role of recording what happens. Not just what went well but also what did not really work, or go as well as one would have expected.</li>
                <li>Record the co-creation activities (afterwards) using notes and input from all the stakeholders and <strong>reflect</strong> on the outcomes. For this we provide a <a className="more-contrast" href="guidebook/materials?downloadName=Co-creation Intervention Record and Reflection Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a> to help prompt you on what to think about in this reflection process. This reflection process is best co-created with the stakeholders (but minimally within the team)</li>
                <li>Create a record in a project reflection journal of what lessons were learnt and what you would <strong>do differently</strong> next time. A <a className="more-contrast" href="guidebook/materials?downloadName=Co-creation Intervention Record and Reflection Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a> is provided for this purpose.</li>

        introduction: <div>
            <p>
                Summative evaluations can be undertaken either at intervals or towards the end of co-creation activities. Summative evaluation aims at assessing the quality of the outputs, rather than the process, of a co-creation project. In contrast to formative evaluation, it is more outwardly directed – it does not address an internal audience of a project’s participants and stakeholders but intends to demonstrate that the outputs of the process are of a sufficient quality, to a (possibly only potential) external audience. Summative evaluations enable reflection and can input into periodic project reports.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding access to <strong>digital solutions</strong>, older adults can be placed on spectrums both of different degrees of ownership of, or access to mobile devices, and of skill and competences in using them. As potential and actual users, project participants (older adults themselves and/or intermediaries and other stakeholders) are experts in how to design the project outputs to be properly accessible to their intended beneficiaries.
            </p>
            <p>This is why the evaluative criteria for summative evaluation focus on three sorts of outputs/outcomes – apps, data, and the digital service – using the following five criteria.</p>
