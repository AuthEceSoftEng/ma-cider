This will be a MERN app.

## Developer guidelines

### Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start development with `npm run dev`. Each code change is loaded automatically.
3. If you want a production build of the client react app hit `npm run client-build`. Then you can open the server with `npm start`
