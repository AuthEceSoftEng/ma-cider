                        The basic credo of co-creation is that digital services co-created with prospective users are more relevant, have a larger outreach and therefore a greater impact and that they achieve the social objective to a higher degree. It is the objective of this stream to identify, recruit and engage people that represent the different sub-groups within the target audience as well as software developers, data owners and in particular in external projects organizations that may take over the service provision, technical hosting, editorial works etc.

                    <p>
                        A crucial assumption is that people participate as volunteers because of an intrinsic motivation and an interest in the subject, to prove that they have something of value to contribute. To recruit these volunteers is more difficult than to hire someone for a well-defined job. They have to integrate the co-creation activities and meetings in their individual time schedules.

                    <p>
                        Based on the preliminary problem focus, value proposition and target audience (as defined in the <a href="guidebook/methods/details/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project management plan</a>) the next step is to become more precise with respect to the co-creators to be involved. Not all beneficiaries associated with the social objective may benefit equally from a service and may not become users themselves (e.g. because they lack digital skills, financial resources, infrastructure). In order to involve a representative group of co-creators it is important to understand the different ways in which people may benefit the service with respect to their life situation and everyday practices. The ISO Norm on usability (ISO 9241-11) requires system developers to classify users and to study their use contexts in order find out how the system may achieve the social objectives. Among others, access to digital devices and digital literacy among different target audience(s) have to be identified. This for example can be done via <a href="guidebook/methods/details/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>. Hence, intermediaries may be another relevant target audience who use the digital service to improve their primary service and should be engaged as co-creators as well. Therefore, a focus should be put on the organisations that provide support to the target audience.

                        Each of the target audiences (e.g. subgroups) have to be approached by considering their (potential) reasons for participation and the communication channels to contact them have to be selected (online and offline). The project board has to define the different tasks and roles that co-creators may assume. By considering the tasks, a list of capabilities and expertise can be compiled which co-creators need to contribute. The project board members needs to define which stakeholders/individuals should be included and how they can be approached, e.g. by attending events, contacting organisations, issuing releases or contacting local newspapers to present the project together with a call for participation, and holding <a href="guidebook/methods/details/13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information events</a>.

                        On any channel there is a need for precise and understandable <a href="guidebook/materials?downloadName=Inform Participants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participant information</a>, including

                        As mentioned, there is the option for participation in a permanent core group or of limited dedicated contributions. The process has to be continued until all required capabilities are covered.

                        In many cases, the problem focus and tasks change during the project: New ideas may be developed that require additional tasks and capabilities, or some members may leave the project early. Therefore, it is important to recruit and engage groups or individuals that complement already involved knowledge and expertise as well as skills throughout the co-creation process. In order to do so we recommend identifying local groups of stakeholders that engage in activities related to the problem focus and objectives of the process (e.g. local computer courses for older adults).

                                        According to our experiences it is difficult to recruit people for a process where the problem to be solved is not yet identified, it might be better to identify the problems with a group of people that are recruited for this particular task and not for the whole process. It is also important to consider the problems with different stakeholders. This may include intermediaries who have experience in working with older people. Further, attending to a wider group of older citizens other than just those that have agreed to co-create allows for a broader understanding of the problem domain. Exploring the problem situation with a wide group of stakeholders helps to better situate the project within the specific social/political/historical contexts of the problem domain.

                                        During the co-creation activities extensive work may have to be devoted to identifying existing open data as well as data validation, integration and, ultimately, also data creation. Depending on the problem domain, there is a high chance that only a small amount of the required data are available and even these may have to be validated for being up to date and complete.
    <br />
                                        Even if the data are available, co-creators may identify additional attributes that they deem relevant. Hence, supplementary data may have to be collected or created by participants and other experts. If a crowd-sourcing approach is chosen, the generated data may be partly inconsistent and, subsequently, may have to be checked and validated as well as harmonised further.

                                        Interface design and the development of a database are two tasks usually carried out by different experts. The communication of requirements on both issues could be more effective when formalised in an agile software development approach.

                                        One of the most challenging roles for older adults is that of a designer. During our co-creation activities, many participants experienced the prototyping, in particular paper prototyping, as tedious and annoying. It may be required to provide more guidance to inexperienced participants or recruit other participants for these tasks. In addition, an ICT helpdesk for participants throughout the process may be an effective way for receiving informed feedback.
