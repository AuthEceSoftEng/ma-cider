            <p>
                This guidebook is based on co-creation activities conducted within the EU-funded Mobile-Age project (2016-2019). In four different field sites across Europe (South Lakeland, UK; Bremen, Germany; Thessaloniki, Greece and Zaragoza, Spain) we co-created digital public services for and with older adults. Besides the technical results we focussed on the development and deployment of co-creation approaches and methodologies to engage (senior) citizens and intermediaries such as social care service provider effectively. We carefully documented and assessed our activities in order to learn about co-creation and refine our approach. In this guidebook we provide these learnings for future co-creation activities.
