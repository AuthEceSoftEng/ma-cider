Only 2 of the participants were men (!) and a third one (one of the intermediaries). Few of the attendants were from other Open Care Centers. There was a provocative question about which company has made the offers for the tablets to EU indicating that a company may have profitted from this project but we suppose that this type of questions occurs commonly.The room was a bit crowded and in the next room there was an exercise -gym class taking place but it was surprisingly quiet -mostly women took part there, too. Participation would have been much larger a few days earlier but an organised 3-day excursion had started that day, so we had some “leaks”.When they were asked for feedback, most said they found it interesting, they wanted to participate.Some had false impression about what it is and anticipated to find out things about technology and how to use devices and get help on using their mobiles. When we asked them if they understood what it was about, they said yes, but then when further explaining their ideas we realised it was not so clear to them. ",

They were asked for feedback on that first event and they gave a positive feedback but we also realised that they didn’t have a clear view of the project. The 2 interns also provided help to them, took notes and were asked to give us some feedback later. Photos and short videos were taken. We also showed them a tablet like the ones that the project will use. Many had technology -problem related questions that addressed to us.",

(of course I told her that we needed her own view on that).When asked what could be improved in today’s session, a lady told me that we could implement a type of service such as a panic button. Another one, when asked the same question replied that we could extend oasth’s informational service on all bus stops. An old man told us I was expecting other things and what I heard from you was different. He wanted to listen about how to use his mobile device and started telling me how he ended up losing all his phone contacts and trying to recover some from his wife’s and sister’s phone. Another lady was enthousiastic about our “seminars” and wanted to learn how to use devices. After most of the people had left, we tried to take a photo and asked her to take one picture with the use of a tablet, in order to help her get a feeling of the device, but she couldn’t do it successfully…Easy access to doctors, appointment booking and medicine might be one of the top issues of their concern.- but that’s without taking note of the answers recorded in questionnaires.They were 17 out of 25 initially interested, which we find a quite large number to handle. We are planning to fix a date (probably the 30th of June) at the next KAPH (Lampraki Area) if people from the RCM Health Department are available.",

Some communication had taken place in the past and a direct link was tested between AUTH and Medical Accosiation of Thessaloniki. However, the quality of the data was not satisfactory. We decided to also ask for the dataset from EOPYY that is in the format AUTH prefers in order to navigate old people to the doctor’s offices and also provides online information on their available appointments since each doctor with EOPYY contract has a limited amount of free appointments per month for insured patients and after the doctor has filled up this number, the next patients have to pay in order to visit the doctor. We also tried to clarify the availability of an added value dataset of SYFA (an organisation related to the pharmacists accosiation) so we made some calls to “key” people in SYFA. We also considered as easy to find and interesting the dataset concerning hospitals on duty.",

We left aside the datasets of rehabilitation centers, opticians and microbiologists as not so interesting according to the first questionnaires. After some communication with the Open Care Centers, the 15th of December was the date fixed for the 1st workshop because all Open Care Centers had a Christmas fest on the 14th.

Regarding the services related to the pharmacies, the participants stated that they were covered by the predicted services (electronic sending the medical description to the pharmacy in order to get feedback on its availability, direct information about the on-call pharmacies in a designated area, as well as direct communication and navigation to the selected pharmacy) and provided a list with the pharmacies that they deal with, so that they get included in the application. As far as other services are concerned, apart from information regarding the on-call hospitals by specialty and geographical area, the participants asked to be also informed about the availability of medical appointments at the out-patients clinics. Moreover, in addition to receiving sms alert about the levels of air pollution, the participants asked to get also relevant sms about the levels of humidity. Finally, they stressed out the need to have access to speed dial buttons to emergency services - ambulance, police, fire brigade - and to close relatives. ",

      "notes": "The social activities manager of the local protestant church and project team member had advertised the project and organized the focus group. She had put out a flyer and addressed people personally. Two older adults from the neighbourhood attended the meeting. One of them, Mr. Meyer, had already participated in phase one in Osterholz. He is part of the project team and very valuable for us as an expert in different areas: He knows the project and the outcome from the first phase, he knows Hemelingen very well, he engages active in Openstreetmap and will provide us with geo data on places and he is very skilled with ICT’s. He supports us with the organization and implementation particularly of the data collection. Furthermore, he is attending all the focus groups. The other participant was a woman aged 75 who had just moved to the neighbourhood some month ago. Before, she had lived in another neighbourhood in Hemelingen. Besides the social activity manager from the church, two ifib researchers participated. The focus group took place in the community building of the protestant church of the district, hostet by the project group member who had organized the meeting. \r\nWe started by telling something about the project. The female participant was quite interested in the question of demographic change, how it affects society and if it is a problem in other countries as well. She seemed very interested and she filled out and signed the consent form. She started to talk about the district and things she dislikes about it. She, for example, engages in cleaning the neighbourhood by picking up waste and she complained about dog dirt that dog owners would leave in the street. She also complained about the closing of retail stores and said that instead more and more hairdressers would open up. This was commented by the social activity member, who said that the reason might be all the men who would care about shaving a lot (which somehow seemed to be a reference to men with migration background). Furthermore, the female participant does volunteer work looking after people with mental health problems, which was her profession before she retired. She presented herself as not interested in the use of digital technologies: “I don’t need this anymore”. However, it turned out that her daughter tries to convince her to use a smartphone and that she has tried several times. When we encountered some problems with the tablets, she was relieved: “Oh I thought this would only happen to me. I am happy to see, that also other people face these problems”.\r\nWe started to talk about the information sources available and used in the district. Since she does not use the internet, for the female participant different kind of print media are her primary information source. She also said that she gets her information by getting around in the district (“first hand”) and by talking to people. For the other participant besides print media, Google is an important information source also regarding events in the district.\r\nThe female participant is very knowledgeable about the district. She knows lots of places and people. No matter what topic we addressed, she knew something to tell about it from the district perspective. Obviously, she preferred talking about places and people than about categories and attributes as we had planned to do. Therefore we had a lively discussion, which was difficult to steer in the direction we had planned.  \r\nThe social activities manager raised the question, if a category like “health”, where for example pharmacies would be shown, would not be important to include in the district guide. However, we finally agreed, that most people would know the pharmacies and doctors close to them. The same applies to for example shops.\r\nWhen we talked about the category “sport” the participant said, that in her opinion a broader term like ‘exercise’ would be better, because “sport” makes her think of football and other more “fun” oriented or institutionalized forms of exercise, whereas for older adults health related kinds of exercise are much more important.  \r\nThe relevance of the category “nice places” was confirmed. The participants furthermore stressed the importance of (information on) benches and toilets for this category. Interestingly she told that even if the need for toilets is a problem for almost all older people this is mostly addressed by men. \r\nThe female participants rides a bike, which is “not a normal but a special kind of bike”. She also uses public transportation. \r\n\r\nThe recruitment of an “open” focus group (in addition to the recruitment of existing groups) did not work well. Only one participant had come. We will announce the next focus group in the newspaper to reach more people. \r\nIt was difficult to steer the discussion. Maybe the small size of the group was one aspect of this. \r\nThe female participant is particularly competent and knowledgeable regarding the district and hence very well suited for the data-creation phase.

      "notes": "Monia Akkermann had promoted the project among a group of 35 people with mental health problems. 5 interested people had shown up for the focus group: One woman and 4 men, one of them fits the image of a “senior citizen” the other 4 people seemed relatively young (maybe 40-50 years old). The focus group was held in a nice and bright room in the day care center of ASB, where people from all over the district can come during the day to meet others, We started by telling something about the project. \r\n- One male (ca. 50 years old) who is working fulltime in sheltered workshops, does not use internet or any digital devices and seems quite worried about many things. He could express himself very well, but often brought-up different very personal topics. \r\n- One male (ca 50) who was very reluctant and quiet and does not use internet or any digital devices. He left before we finished but took a probes bag and promised to come to the next meeting\r\n- One male (ca. 50) who almost did not say anything. He has written in the “e-mail address” column on the participants list “am interested, but FAIL in the USAGE”\r\n- One male (ca 70) who uses the internet and works as volunteer\r\n- One female (ca 45) who is experienced with digital media and calls herself a “profi when it comes to the internet”. She was very open minded and told us that she has already “made a website herself”. She is passionate hobby photographer and has problems with social contacts. She was very determined that she did not want to be photographed. \r\nBefore starting the audio record, we handed out the consent forms. The participants seemed a bit overburdened with it and we decided to let them take it home and fill it out there. They all gave us verbal consent for the audio record. \r\nDuring the whole session a lot of questions popped up, like \r\n- what the connection to English cities are\r\n- why we need something digital when there are lots of printed information\r\n- why in the guide for Osterholz there are lot of things not only interesting for older but also younger people\r\nThe cultural probes seemed to surprise the participants and rise interest for the project.\r\nThe consent form is barely reasonable and too difficult to understand. It made people feel like participating would mean to consent to a lot of dangerous things with consequences they cannot really estimate.\r\nDue to very different attention spans and difficulties to focus on one topic “classical” workshops tools like printed handouts or pin board did not work. An open discussion seemed most appropriate. However, some participants would only say something if addressed directly. \r\nTalking about concrete places that people know was much more interesting for the participants then talking about abstract “topics” or “attributes”. Hence, the group seems very fit for data collection. ",

      "outcome": "Arouse interest among 6 participants from Arbergen\r\nThe main problem/topic for these people is mobility and physical accessibility. Many of them have reduced mobility (cannot walk long distances, have problems with stairs, etc.) and they lack possibilities to go somewhere. An idea for the service is to extend the district guide on places and institutions with more detailed information on access and mobility (e.g. information/communication on support services and benefits, on connecting routes from and to stations, car and taxi sharing) for the respective places.\r\nThe category “sport” should be renamed\r\nWe agreed on the 6th June 2017 as date for the next focus group.",
      "notes": "The focus group took place in the meeting room of the residence. 6 residents had come, most of them are in the tablet group of the residence and hence know how to use internet and tablet. The director of the home and member of the project team introduced the ifib team and then left. \r\nWe introduced the project and ourselves. Then the participants introduced themselves and where asked to tell why they were interested in the project. The participants were 1 married couple that lives in the residence for two years, all the other female participants were single (mostly widowed), they moved to the residence between 10 to 2 years ago. All participants lived in Bremen for a long time, though most of them had lived in different districts before moving to the residence home. Overall the residence is home to 11 married couples and 16 single women (out of which 13 are over 80 years). One of our participants established a monthly “talking café” for these single women, where they meet and talk. All agreed that these social contacts were of great importance. Someone said that these conversations “make you mobile”/”move you” and that too little was done for the “soul”. All the others agreed. They also repeatedly stated that there was only very little to do in the close proximity of the care home (e.g. no cafés, no shops) as opposed to what some of the participants were used to when they still lived in the city centre. \r\nThe participants also told us that they plan for a few joint excursions per year. Asked how they obtain information about their destination, they replied that they usually only ever go to places they know and that they would like to visit again. \r\nAs for technology, most of them were interested in technology and affirmed that they use their tablets regularly. One participant did not use a tablet at all but stated her interest when asked. One female participant mentioned that she started working with a computer in 1992. Overall, the participants seemed well educated and well-off. Several participants mentioned that they had sold their houses in order to move to the residence. Repeatedly, participants made reference to their work life.\r\nWe skipped the handout of consent forms, since it would have interrupted the flow of discussion. It seemed that they had read the information brochure carefully and had thought about the project.Many of them were quite critical about the project, because as they said “not the information about places and institutions is the problem, but that you won’t get there”. Some of the participants cannot walk long distances and use a rollator. For them the biggest problem is getting to the bus/tram station and from the station to their destination. Most of them use Taxi when they really need to go somewhere (e.g. to the doctor), but can’t afford to use it often (e.g. for leisure activities). Other participants are very mobile and some of them have a car. Between the participants there seemed a good atmosphere: It seemed they all liked, respected and helped each other. However, the idea of sharing a car or taxi  triggered some reservation as they were not convinced that it would work, because as they said most other residents in the home wouldn’t be able to plan and coordinate such things. It seems that these people are very active, interested and solidary group as distinguished from the rest of the residents. It turned out that some of them didn’t know about certain support services that they are eligible for (e.g. rollator courses from the public transport operators, new regulations state support benefits). \r\nWith the handout of the screenshots as well as tablets the participants looked at the digital district guide for Osterholz. Overall, it seemed to make a very good impression and consolidated the people’s interest in our project. Like in the first focus group the participants didn’t like the term “sport” for the category for physical activities. One woman argued: “sport sounds too much like performance and exhausting”. For them especially health-oriented activities like kneipp cure or activities like pottery are interesting.\r\nFinally, we handed out consent form to be filled out until the next meeting and cultural probes. It was a little difficult to determine a date for our next meeting. As some of the participants are very busy. Almost all of them had to consult their diaries.\r\n\r\nThe participants were critical about our idea to develop and provide technology that should solve their problems. They experience their needs more as a lack of infrastructure than a lack of information.\r\nThe participants were very open minded, active and engaged. They themselves reminded us that they are not representative for all residence and that most people in the residence are much more passive, disinterested and immobile. ",

The same 6 residents had come (one arrived a little late) and Mr. Meyer was there.\r\nWhile we waited for the last participants to come, a discussion unfold about children playing on the area of the residence. The participants complained about the noisy and naughty children. \r\nWhen everyone had arrived one female participant started saying, that they all wanted to say something regarding the cultural probes and the whole project. She particularly complained about the cultural probes, that she called the “the shock bag”. The main critique points that everyone agreed on were the size of the map (nobody could read it), which they experienced as an unreasonable demand because they simply could not recognize anything and furthermore as an impertinence because it seemed to them we did not have thought about it and willingly had brought them in an unpleasant situation. The postcard where the participants were asked to draw an emblem for the district also arouse anger. It seemed that at least one of the participants viewed this as a ridiculous task. The main point of all of them was, that the extent of the probes (time to invest, things we wanted to know, etc.) was so huge that it scared them and pressurized them, what made them upset.\r\nWe had brought a tablet to borrow it to one of the participants who did not use the internet or any digital devices yet and we had understood that she was interested in doing so. She refused to take it and when asked, said that she had been joking about wanting one. She said that she was too old to start using it and absolutely did not want to. Later she said about the project that she feels as if our goal is to persuade them to use online media, and she stated “And this I don’t want!”\r\nOverall the whole group does not feel like participating in the project would be beneficial for whether them nor for us. The only male participant emphasized, that they lack knowledge about the district, because all of them have not been there for a long time and therefor would not be able to support us.\r\nIn the end, we collected the probes and said goodbye by mutual consent that a collaboration is not beneficial for either of us.\r\nSince we did not get any consent by them, we did not audio record the session.\r\n\r\nWe have to think about the great differences between a group of relatively young, independent living, mobile and active older people and people living in residences. With higher age and physical decline people seem to have completely different needs and attitudes. To start working solely with a group of active older adults restricts the outcome to a very certain user group and excludes others. Hence, we need to address questions of (scarce) resources. \r\nFurther reflection of the cultural probes and the contexts in which to use them is needed. ",

      "notes": "The project meeting has shown, that a more intense exploration of the socio-spatial conditions of a field site is necessary:\r\n1. We need to understand the district, it’s spatial and social divisions, the reasons and effects of this divides\r\n2. We need to know the people better before designing probes for them\r\nThe cultural probes do not work the same way for different older adults. For some people they might be too personal (consider revising the name and age) and people have privacy concerns. We have to make sure before handing them out, that every task is doable (in terms of font size, complexity, extent and willingness). Therefor it might be important to know the participants better when designing the probes and to look at them jointly and explain them before handing them out. \r\nFurthermore local specifics need to be considered (e.g. in Hemelingen it does not make sense to have one map of the whole district but better one map for each neighbourhood). The division between the neighbourhoods are stronger than we had expected. 20 years ago people from Hemelingen and Arbergen wouldn’t even talk to each other (e.g. children were sitting in separate parts of a classroom), today this is getting better but the distance remains (socio-demographic differences). The local service providers encourage us to develop something for the whole district in order to support and facilitate their efforts to unite the district.\r\nFurthermore we were advised not to talk too much about what we did in Osterholz, since there is some kind of comparison and competition between the two districts",

      "notes": "One new participant had come to the meeting. She is a very well looking woman that makes the impression of an intelligent, competent and autonomous woman that is actively engaged in different activities (e.g. sport and related tours to Berlin, volunteer work). She lives in Hemelingen for 50 years and is in her own perspective one of the few people that cross the borders in the district. Hence, she is very knowledgeable about all neighbourhoods and very interested in the district’s development and image. When talking about information sources, she makes clear that she knows where to get information (“I just go there and ask”), but she is aware that other older adults “are fearful” and “don’t dare to go somewhere” because they feel unsecure. Hence, her motivation to participate is that she wants to help people to reduce uncertainties through the provision of information and thereby support their mobility and social life/strengthens their confidence. We talked about the cultural probes first and handed out a bag to the new participant. Later the participants from the first meeting arrives. We talked about places in the district by looking and the map together and later planned the routes for the walks. The participants advised us not to plan the walk for more than two kilometres. Then we decided to include a joint lunch and/or coffee and cake in the walking tours. The idea is that, when we walk together along nice places the people will talk about the places and thereby deliver data for the description. One big topic were people with migrant background, especially girls wearing scarf what is seen as a symbol of oppression.\r\n\r\nThe two participants in this group are knowledgeable residents of Hemelingen that identify with the district, care about its image and are interested in uniting the different neighbourhoods. In this respect, they differ very much from the group in Arbergen and are perfectly qualified for the data collection. Interestingly none of them complained about the cultural probes. ",

He lives in Hasted and had brought a befriended couple that also lives in Hastedt. One of the other participants (m) from the last meeting called me later to apologize for not beeing there. He wanted to come, but couldn’t do it. He told me on the phone that he had filled out the probes and offered to send it via post. \r\nWe started by talking about the project since the new participants didn’t know about it. The other participant had shown the cultural probes and the brochure to them and they were interested. No one of them had filled out the probes. And the participant from the last meeting also didn’t want to fill out the consent form even if he is very interested and engaged.\r\nThe conversation returned to the segregation of the district of Hemelingen. All three participants live in Hasted which is very close to the inner part of the city. They emphasized that Hasted is very different to the other neighbourhoods in Hemelingen and that it is much more urban than the rest. They feel much closer to the district that borders Hastedt in the west, which one of the most popular districts of Bremen. It seemed that the rest of Hemelingen to them is either rural and boring or socially problematic. These people, especially the couple, seem to be well educated, open minded, healthy and active (e.g. sport clubs). The woman told that she had used a computer for work but since twenty years does not use it, because she doesn’t like to. It seems that for her life should more take place in “reality” than via media. However, she and her husband were interested in the project and wanted to take a look at the district guide for Osterholz.\r\nTogether we looked at the Hastedt part of the printed district guide, discussed the relevance of the places and added further missing places. Most of the nice and interesting places for them however do not belong to Hemelingen, but to the inner parts of the city which in their case is their direct neighbourhood. \r\nIn the end the participants who had already been in the first meeting brought up the topic of lacking skills regarding digital media and the internet amongst older people. He asked if this shouldn’t be the first step before doing a project like ours. He reported of problems he had had himself (e..g. with sending emails from his smartphone) and how he had tried to get help from his son/son-in-law on the phone. He complained that “young people” do not understand the problems older people have and that his younger relatives are too impatient to help him. I recommended him to go to a computer club for older adults if he would need help and could convince him of the relevance of our project anyway. \r\n\r\nThe three participants are very active and knowledgeable people. However, their knowledge about the district is limited since they are more oriented to the city center. But they seemed to be at least interested in getting to know other party of Hemelingen.",

We had chosen a route from the printed district guide and promoted the walk in the newspapers, via the intermediaries and in an online event calendar. We had chosen to promote the walk as a joint walk through the district in the first place, in order to keep the barriers for participation low. \r\nWe started with a short introduction of the project. Then we started walking along the route. On our way we came across a senior resident home and picked up two more participants. One of them has a mobility device. This woman showed us a hidden garden we didn’t had planned to visit. We further came along the “Bürgerhaus” which is an important place in the district (events, coffee, meeting people), walked through a park which is quite disputed (some people like it and other totally dislike it) and other places. One participant is quite new in the district. She moved there from another German city, because her children live there and they wanted to be able to take care of her. She told us that she misses her old city and her social contacts there, but is very eager to get to know people in her new environment (e.g. bridge group). All the others have lived in the district for a long time and are very knowledgeable about it. They had a lot to tell about the historical developments in the district, which turned out to be a main point of interest, when walking. \r\nOn the half way we made a coffee break in the “Bürgerhaus”, where the particioants were asked to fill out the questionnaire on attributes. Many of them said, that they were not very interested in attributes for accessibility but much more in the history of places.\r\nWe continued the walk through another park and came across a “Geschirrmanufaktur”, whose former owner is a very known person in the district. Then we had lunch at a restaurant/café called “Eisen werner” which had been an iron shop and a very institution in the district before. After closing the iron shop a second hand shop had reopened combindes with a restaurant and café where they serve lunch for low prices.\r\nWhile eating lunch again people talked a lot about the history of the district and their personal stories. When we wanted to show the Osterholz district guide on the tablet in the end, the participants were reluctant but then showed some interest and positive reactions. \r\nWe had planned to hand out the amended cultural probes, but together with the intermediary we decided not to give them out at this point, since we were afraid it would be to much. We gave out the information brochures and then discussed a date for our next meeting. Again the patricipants were reluctant to commit themselves to come, but most said they wanted to try.\r\n\r\nAfter our experiences with the last focus groups we decided to be more slowly with giving information on the project and asking people to commit themselves to certain task and the project. It seems that it is very important first to get to know the people and the district, to raise trust and interest, before asking people for their engagement. \r\nTo walk together, talk about the district and its history and to show interest in the people and what they want to talk about seems to be very important in order to raise trust. We almost didn’t talk about technology. ",

The participants listened and looked at it, but did not have any opinion on whether they liked it or not. By contrast – when talking about the last walk and the POI’s on the way they were eager in talking about them and sharing their knowledge. In particular one of the participants was very active. Sometimes it was even difficult to make her stop talking. This participants also came up with the idea for another walk in Seebaldsbrück. When defining the route for the next step the participants jointly worked on the route together with Karin Schüdde and without any intervention of the researchers.\r\n\r\nThe small number of participants and the limited interest of those who were there shows that recruitment was not successful.

This participant had a lot of personal as well as historical stories and anecdotes to tell about the different areas we passed on the way. He is a valuable source of information on Arbergen. However, it seemed that some of the participants that had already been involved in the first walk felt disregarded, because he put himself in the foreground. Since we were audio recording the talking on the walk, the microphone even seemed to intensify the resentment in the group: The dominant participant closely stayed with the microphone all the time, while the group split into two or more small groups. After a while the intermediary asked the participant to withhold a bit and the confidence improved and there was a nice atmosphere while walking, watching and talking. \r\nWhile finally drinking coffee together it was again difficult to stop the participants from giving a talk. However, he agreed with us to organize another walk in Arbergen that he will lead anf that will focus on the historical development of the neighbourhood.\r\nIn the end we wanted to hand out consent forms but most participants didn’t want to even take a look at it.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully capture the statements of the participants at least one more microphone is necessary.

      "notes": "Unfortunately only three out of six registered participants came to the workshop. We started by handing out the consent forms and broschures and to talk about the project. The participants filled out the forms. Then we started talking about their previous experiences with digital devices and/or the internet. One of them, Eva Warnke, has never used any digital device before. Ulrich Bäcker uses an ipad, a smartphone and computer and Rita Rübe has few experiences with smartphohe and computer. Mrs. Warnke told us, that her daughter had given her a smartphone some time ago, but that she had given it back, because she did not know how to use it and felt let alone with it. She was involved in the project from the beginning on. When we had talked about tablets, internet and so on in the beginning she had been very rejecting and had told us that she did not want to have anything to do with this. During the walks we had got to know each other and she had become much more talkative and open minded. In the workshop she constantly repeated that she would probably be too stupid and too slow to understand it and that she would just try it out but did not want to promise that she would continue with using the tablet. She obviously had the impression that she would be dismissed from the participation, when she would fail in handling the tablet. We assured her that it was not our concern to test her, but that it would be our own failure if we wouldn't succeed in teaching her the use. We also assured that she commited herself to nothing and that she could stop at any time. \r\nWe had prepared an instruction for the basic functionalities of the tablet. Along this we jointly turned on the device, entered the pin codes and started to look at the start page. While one of the researchers showed and explained the steps another one was sitting besides Mrs. Warnke and helped her follow. Then we asked the participants which of the installed apps (Mobileage prototype, Youtube, GoogleMaps, Chrome, camera, galery, public transport) they were most interested in. Rita Rübe wanted to explore Youtube.  The handling of the Youtube app turned out to be callenging: Finding the search box was difficult, since you only see the symbol and first when touching it, it opens up. When playing a video it was hard for them to know how to stop it since the play button disappears after a while and only appears again when touching the screen. And the function that - while searching for another video - the video continues in a small screen in the lower corner of the display confused them. Eva Warnke expressed her fear that she would never be able to get along with the tablet on her own. On the question if there was no tablet or coputer group for older adults in the distrcit she answeared that there was one but it was booked out already. \r\nThese kind of in-between-talks always led to discussion among the participants about the district, where something is, who comes from what neighbourhood and so on. Interestingly one of the, Eva Warnke, comes from the neighbourhhod Hemelingen, the other two from Arbergen. It was very interesting to see how they freely talked about their mutual prejudices and started to make fun of it together and theryby to overcome them. However, we as facilitators did not want to interrupt these kind of talks but on the other hand wanted to continue with our agenda. We succeeded in doing so when taking the topic of their discussion as starting point and relate it to the technology. For instance when talking about were the computer classes for older adults take place, we showed them GoogleMaps and so they could directly show the other one on the map where something is located. When we explored GoogleMaps it turned out that even Mr. Bäcker who had used the app some times, did not know that it is possible to navigate with it. We then tried out the app of the public transportation, which worked quite well.  \r\nAfter an hour of working with the tablets we asked if they still wanted to try some more or if it was enough. Mrs. Rübe wanted to try out the camera app, but Mrs. Warnke said that \"her head was buzzing\" and that she was not able to take in more information.\r\nFinally we gave out some broschures for senior citizens starting to use tablets and the charging cable for the tablet. Mrs. Warnke had a lot of questions, like what happend when the tablet got stolen and the like. She seemed really nervous and excited at the same time. She also asked what all of this would cost her, and was positive surprised, that the EU covers all the cost. We also told them to call us if they had any problems they needed help with. For instance in case of a system update or any other sudden message that appears it seemed to us that they needed a contact person.\r\n\r\nThe group size was not too big at all, more people would have made it much harder especially for those who don't have any experiences. In order to reduce the feeling of uncertainty or even fear a one-to-one support seems necessary. Different levels of competencies make it much more difficult. We have to think about, how to continue and how to deal with these disparities without leaving someone behind.",

We had prepared a presentation on the walks we have conducted so far. Since few participants had participated in all the walks, we wanted to recap the conducted activities and give a first impression of the material collected. At the same time mapping the walks and adding pictures gave them an impression of the app we want to develop. The participants enjoyed to see an interim outcome of the activities and seemed to get an impression of the goal of the field work. We then looked at different examples for mapping and editing digital walks/places. we also showed the Osterholz App which the participants really liked. Afterwards we had a discussion were some participants came up with first design ideas (filter for nature/nice walks and historical walks and for implementing \"virtual walks\" (video that captures the walk i.e. with Mapillary)). Finally we presented the draft agenda for the design phase and agreed on the dates. In the end we handed out tablets to those participants who do not have their own and who had not been in the first tablet group. Eva Warnke who had had her first intercation with a dgital device in the first tablet group had used the tablet several times at home but found it too frustrating and gave the tablet back. However she still wants to participate.",

      "notes": "Six participants had come to the workshop. FR had prepared a short presentation where he showed, what we wanted to work on (drafts for the different views/screens of the walks). He had also prepared blank templates on tablet screens as well as buttons, map backgrounds, texts, symbols and so forth to glue them on the screens. We had brought scissors, pencils, paper. After the presentation the idea was that the participants form groups and together with the researchers worked on the screens. They seemed quite reluctant in the first place. We then asked, if they felt like doing the paper work themselves or if they would prefer to discuss in the whole group and let us do the paper work, what trhey preferred. So we gathered around some flipcharts and started discussing the first screen (an overview over all walks in the map). It turend out that there was a productive mix of different competecncies amongst the participants: The men were very much interested in the technical output and showed to have experience in navigating sites and reflecting on their own experiences. In addition the woman contributed a social dimension to the discussion. Ursula Greve who is member of the local advisory council, said that it would be very important to have a overview over the whole district with all it's different neighbourhoods on the first screen, in order to counteract the segregation of the district and foster a district wide sense of community. \r\nDoing the paper-prototyping the participants engaged actively in the discussions around the disposition of the different elements. And again it became clear that ICT-skilled participants are much more well suited for design questions, whereas participants with no or low ICT-experience tend to discuss more content related aspects.
