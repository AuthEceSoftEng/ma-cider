Only 2 of the participants were men (!) and a third one (one of the intermediaries). Few of the attendants were from other Open Care Centers. There was a provocative question about which company has made the offers for the tablets to EU indicating that a company may have profitted from this project but we suppose that this type of questions occurs commonly.The room was a bit crowded and in the next room there was an exercise -gym class taking place but it was surprisingly quiet -mostly women took part there, too. Participation would have been much larger a few days earlier but an organised 3-day excursion had started that day, so we had some “leaks”.When they were asked for feedback, most said they found it interesting, they wanted to participate.Some had false impression about what it is and anticipated to find out things about technology and how to use devices and get help on using their mobiles. When we asked them if they understood what it was about, they said yes, but then when further explaining their ideas we realised it was not so clear to them. ",

They were asked for feedback on that first event and they gave a positive feedback but we also realised that they didn’t have a clear view of the project.

(of course I told her that we needed her own view on that).When asked what could be improved in today’s session, a lady told me that we could implement a type of service such as a panic button. Another one, when asked the same question replied that we could extend oasth’s informational service on all bus stops. An old man told us I was expecting other things and what I heard from you was different. He wanted to listen about how to use his mobile device and started telling me how he ended up losing all his phone contacts and trying to recover some from his wife’s and sister’s phone. Another lady was enthousiastic about our “seminars” and wanted to learn how to use devices. After most of the people had left, we tried to take a photo and asked her to take one picture with the use of a tablet, in order to help her get a feeling of the device, but she couldn’t do it successfully…Easy access to doctors, appointment booking and medicine might be one of the top issues of their concern.- but that’s without taking note of the answers recorded in questionnaires.They were 17 out of 25 initially interested, which we find a quite large number to handle. We are planning to fix a date (probably the 30th of June) at the next KAPH (Lampraki Area) if people from the RCM Health Department are available.",

We decided to also ask for the dataset from EOPYY that is in the format AUTH prefers in order to navigate old people to the doctor’s offices and also provides online information on their available appointments since each doctor with EOPYY contract has a limited amount of free appointments per month for insured patients and after the doctor has filled up this number, the next patients have to pay in order to visit the doctor.

While presenting the basic features of the application, the participants gave their feedback by fulfilling a related assessment questionnaire.

The basic services of the application were assessed positively in general. Apart from the basic services related to medical doctors (information about doctors of specific medical specialty in a designated area and EOPYY contracted, as well as direct communication and navigation to the selected doctor), the participants asked to be also informed about the availability of medical appointments of the certain doctor. Regarding the services related to the pharmacies, the participants stated that they were covered by the predicted services (electronic sending the medical description to the pharmacy in order to get feedback on its availability, direct information about the on-call pharmacies in a designated area, as well as direct communication and navigation to the selected pharmacy) and provided a list with the pharmacies that they deal with, so that they get included in the application. As far as other services are concerned, apart from information regarding the on-call hospitals by specialty and geographical area, the participants asked to be also informed about the availability of medical appointments at the out-patients clinics. Moreover, in addition to receiving sms alert about the levels of air pollution, the participants asked to get also relevant sms about the levels of humidity. Finally, they stressed out the need to have access to speed dial buttons to emergency services - ambulance, police, fire brigade - and to close relatives. ",

The questions corresponded to the interface of the application (eg. do you want bigger fonts?)  and also to the further improvement of the health services in order to better suit the needs of senior citizens (eg. do you want to be able to search many doctors specialties each time?).
